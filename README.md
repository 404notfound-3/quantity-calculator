# Basics of Quantity Calculation (Position Sizing)

Position Sizing, One of the most ignored aspects of trading by new traders. Generally in new traders I have seen a desire to use the entire capital for trading. First thing a trader should lose is the idea of using entire capital every trade. How much capital to use, what quantity to buy, these are defined by position sizing.
